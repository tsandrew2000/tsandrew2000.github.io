<div class="description">
<p>I grew up in one of coldest part of the Globe - Western Siberia, so when I moved to the USA, I did not want to ever see snow again, that is how I ended up moving to San Francisco. I have lived in Bay Area for over 15 years and I never really wanted to trade this place for any other although one of my passions is travelling. Since my current work allows me to do it remotely, I am away for at least 3 months every year. But every time I come back to San Francisco, I know that this place is my favorite.</p>

<div class="below">
<p>Several years ago I decided to possibly switch a career from Finance to Computer Science. CCSF was very helpful in that since I could take lots of online courses. I have already gained several Certificates of Achievement such as Lunux Administration, Devops, and Data Science. I think I would also like to recevie Certificate in Frond End Development. I really enjoyed Python, Linux, and Data Visualization classes, and I am looking forward to taking some more courses that would allow to focus more on front end side. I see myself to eventually incorporating all skills I have achieved in order to get a position of a full stack developer or similar position.</p>
