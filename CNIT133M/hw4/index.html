<h2>Characteristics of PWA</h2>
<p>There are some distinguished characteristics and attributes that make an app a PWA. Below are some progressive web apps features: </p>
<p>Progressive<br>

  A progressive web app should work on any device and operating system. The app enhances progressively taking advantage of any features available on the userâ€™s device and browser. The method of gradual improvement is a basic principle of how a PWA operates. </p>
<p>Responsive <br>
  A PWAs UI must fit any form factor and screen size. A progressive web app looks good regardless of the device, has a near native look and feel and offers a seamless experience across all devices. 
</p>
<p>Safe <br>
  Since a progressive web app renders a more intimate user experience, so to prevent spoofing and interception of data, the app is hosted over HTTPS.</p>
